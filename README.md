The project aims to **address the challenge of empowering users to make informed decisions about color choices** in various contexts, such as fashion, cosmetics, or art. Many people struggle with selecting the right colors that match their preferences or suit their specific needs. Additionally, traditional methods of trying on colors, such as swatching or sampling, can be time-consuming and inefficient. The problem statement revolves around **simplifying the color selection process and enhancing the user experience by leveraging technology.**

# Solution
Our solution provides a unique and innovative approach to color analysis and try-on by combining artificial intelligence(AI) with augmented reality (AR). By combining a color analyzer with AR try-on functionality, users can accurately assess how different colors look on them or in their environment before making a decision. This approach distinguishes itself from existing methods by offering a more interactive and immersive experience. It empowers users to explore a wide range of colors effortlessly, leading to more confident and satisfying decisions.
